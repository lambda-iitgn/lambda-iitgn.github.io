* /Welcome to ,\ AMBDA!/
** /What is ,\ AMBDA?/
   ,\ AMBDA. is a PLT hobby group at IIT Gandhinagar. It was formed as a hobby group in October 2024, and will (hopefully) be soon formally established as a club. 
** /What is PLT?/
   PLT stands for programming language theory. Programming language theory has had a long history, with the lambda calculus (our namesake) being formalised by Alonzo Church in the 1930s.
** /How does ,\ AMBDA engage with PLT?/
   Many ways. In particular, our overarching goals are -
   + spread awareness of PLT and related topics on the IITGN campus.
   + stay in touch with research in PLT, both past and current.
   + keep in touch with /people/ engaged with PLT, whether they be in academia or industry.
   + conduct meaningful projects which should, at the very least, contribute to the understanding of the students involved in them.
